The feather board connects the keyboard matrix to gpio pins.

The feather/kb2040 module should be carefully aligned with the header
so 8 gpio pins connect to the keyboard matrix columns and 8 gpio pins
connect to the keyboard matrix rows.  The board can be connected to
the keyboard via cable or soldered directly on the keyboard PCB header.
