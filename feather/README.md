The feather board connects the keyboard matrix to gpio pins.

The feather/kb2040 module should be carefully aligned with the header
so 8 gpio pins connect to the keyboard columns and 8 gpio pins
connect to the keyboard rows.  The feather board can be connected to
the keyboard in various ways (such as 2x8 IDC cable or soldered directly to the header in the keyboard).
