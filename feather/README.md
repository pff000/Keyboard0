The feather board connects the keyboard matrix to gpio pins.

The feather/kb2040 module should be carefully aligned with the header
so 8 gpio pins connect to the keyboard columns and 8 gpio pins
connect to the keyboard rows.  The feather board can be connected to
the keyboard PCB via 2x8 IDC cable or soldered directly to the header.
